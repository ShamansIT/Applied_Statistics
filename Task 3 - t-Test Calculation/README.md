# Description
Calculate the t-statistic for the resting heart rates of patients before and after a two-week exercise program.

## Project Stages:


## Purpose of the Project 


## Methodology


## Descriptions


## Conclusions
As conclusions **can be sure of the accuracy of the calculations and the correctness of the test**.

1.	Precision of Manual Calculations
A very small difference confirms that the manual calculation of the t-statistic was performed correctly and with sufficient accuracy, using formulas for the mean and standard deviation of the differences.
2.	Reliability of the SciPy library
Since the scipy.stats result is virtually identical to our manual calculation, this confirms the reliability and accuracy of the SciPy library for statistical tests in Python.
3.	Machine error
The difference between calculations can be explained as machine error, which occurs due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers in computing systems. This error is normal and does not affect the results of the analysis.



### Final Thoughts


## Next steps witch was done


## Project structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:
- 'task3_t-Test_Calculation.ipynb' is the main Jupyter Notebook, where calculations and explanations are performed.
- 'README.md' â€” project description and instructions.


## Requirements
To complete the project, you must have:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- SciPy
- NumPy
