# Description
This project involves analyzing the PlantGrowth dataset, which includes data on plant weights across three groups: a control group (ctrl) and two treatment groups (trt1 and trt2). The analysis employs statistical techniques such as t-tests and ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences between these groups.

## Project Stages:
1.	Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and cleaned for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualizations provide an overview of the data.
3.	T-Test: A t-test is conducted to compare the mean weights between two treatment groups.

## Purpose of the Project 
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Identify significant differences in plant weights between groups.
- Demonstrate the use of statistical techniques such as t-tests and ANOVA in real-world scenarios.
- Provide insights into the effects of treatments on plant growth.

## Methodology
- T-Test: Used to compare means between trt1 and trt2 groups, ensuring assumptions of normality and equal variances are met.
- ANOVA: Applied to analyze differences among all three groups while controlling for multiple comparisons.

## Descriptions
- Dataset:
    - weight: Numeric variable representing the dried weight of plants.
    - group: Categorical variable representing treatment groups (ctrl, trt1, trt2).
- T-Test:
    - Compares trt1 and trt2 to assess statistical significance.
- ANOVA:
    - Evaluates differences across ctrl, trt1, and trt2 groups.
