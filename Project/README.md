# Description
This project involves analyzing the PlantGrowth dataset, which includes data on plant weights across three groups: a control group (ctrl) and two treatment groups (trt1 and trt2). The analysis employs statistical techniques such as t-tests and ANOVA to determine if there are significant differences between these groups.

## Project Stages:
1.	Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and cleaned for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualizations provide an overview of the data.
