# Description
This project explores the probability of committing a Type II error in one-way ANOVA tests under specific conditions. Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected despite actual differences existing between the groups. The project uses simulations to evaluate this probability and visualize the results.

## Project Stages:

## Purpose of the Project 
The goal of this project is to:
1. Understand the behavior of Type II errors in one-way ANOVA tests.
2. Explore the effect of sample size, variability, and group means on error rates.
3. Provide insights into statistical hypothesis testing through practical implementation.
