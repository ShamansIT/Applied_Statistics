    "This project performs probability analysis using combinatorics methods to solve a modified experiment reminiscent of \"Lady Tasting Tea\". The problem uses 12 cups of tea: 6 of them with milk added first and 6 with tea added initially. The challenge is to calculate the probability that a person will correctly identify all 6 cups of milk added initially, as well as the probability of making one or two mistakes."
