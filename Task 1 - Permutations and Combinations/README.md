# Task 1: Permutations and Combinations
![Lady Tasting Tea](https://e10v.me/tea-tasting-rdd/lady-tasting-tea-small.png)

## Project Description 
This project performs probability analysis using combinatorics methods to solve a modified experiment reminiscent of "Lady Tasting Tea". The problem uses 12 cups of tea: 6 of them with milk added first and 6 with tea added initially. The challenge is to calculate the probability that a person will correctly identify all 6 cups of milk added initially, as well as the probability of making one or two mistakes.

## Project structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:
- 'tasks.ipynb' is the main Jupyter Notebook, where calculations and explanations are performed.
- 'README.md' — project description and instructions.
