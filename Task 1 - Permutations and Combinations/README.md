# Description

## Purpose of the Project 
This project performs probability analysis using combinatorics methods to solve a modified experiment reminiscent of "Lady Tasting Tea". The problem uses 12 cups of tea: 6 of them with milk added first and 6 with tea added initially. The challenge is to calculate the probability that a person will correctly identify all 6 cups of milk added initially, as well as the probability of making one or two mistakes.




## Conclusions
No more than one error: The probability of random success is approximately 4%, which is an acceptable level for a statistically significant outcome.
Two mistakes: The probability rises to about 28%, which is too high. This means that more than a quarter of the time, a person can accidentally succeed just by guessing.

### Final Word
This project demonstrates how combinatorics and probability theory can be applied to the analysis of statistical experiments. He emphasizes the importance of understanding probabilities when making decisions based on statistical data.

## Project structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:
- 'tasks.ipynb' is the main Jupyter Notebook, where calculations and explanations are performed.
- 'README.md' — project description and instructions.

## Requirements
To complete the project, you must have:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- 'math'Lib (built into Python)

### Contribution to the project
Contributions are welcome! You can help improve the project by opening an issue or creating a pull request.

### Testing
The code has been tested using various scripts to ensure that it is correct. You can run the tests by running the main.py script and checking the results.
